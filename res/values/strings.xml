    <string name="help_string">WindNow\n\n
            This app manages wind (or weather) stations with a focus on low traffic consumtion.
            One station can only be\n
            &#8226; a single image with a static url.\n
            &#8226; a station provided by wetteronline.com as \"aktuelles Wetter\".\n
            &#8226; the information provided by http://www.provinz.bz.it/wetter/hoehenwindstationen.asp.\n\n
 
To load (or refresh) data for a station either refresh all stations from the settings menu, or long-click 
a station in the list for a selective refresh. Deleting a station is possible by long-clicking.\n\n
            
There are three ways to create new stations:\n
1. Specifying url and name in the \"new station\" dialog in settings.\n
2. Sharing an image or a valid url in an android browser.\n
3. Modifying the (self-explanatory) \"stations\" file in the \"WindNow\" directory on your sd-card.\n\n</string>
